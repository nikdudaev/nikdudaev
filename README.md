## Hi there, I am Nikolay Dudaev

I am a Senior Data Analyst in [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/). I work on building data pipelines, data validation tools, analytics dashboards. The technologies I currently work with:  
- Tableau
- Python
- SQL
- Snowflake

In my free time I am passionate about baseball. I do some side projects related to baseball. I like to work in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), where I create data analysis and data visualization notebooks and apps with Observable Framework. Here are some of my works there:  
- [Baseball Run Expectancy matrix](https://nd.observablehq.cloud/re24/)
- [Predicting Win % buckets probability for New York Yankees](https://observablehq.com/projects/@nd/win-probability)
- [Beta Distibution](https://observablehq.com/@nd/beta-distribution-for-win-probability-calculations)
- [Baseball Run Expectancy Analysis](https://observablehq.com/@nd/baseball-run-expectancy-analysis)
- [Bubble Chart of TV Shows](https://observablehq.com/@nd/bubble-chart-with-d3-with-a-lot-of-interaction-work-in-progre)

My dataviz works are on [Observable](https://observablehq/@nd)

### Other gigs

I am planning to work on a couple of side projects to explore new areas of
learning:
- `bsky-term` a CLI tool that would allow to use Bluesky in terminal
- `pylore`, Python library for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `rustermi` terminal emulator for Linux, written in Rust
- `whoyouwannabe` a tiny social network based on ATProtocol to track your dreams
- I am also working on the collection of Statistic and Probability notebooks
    that could serve as a learning resource.
